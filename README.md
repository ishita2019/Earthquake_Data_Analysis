# Earthquake_Data_Analysis
Analysis and Visualization of Earthquake prone zones worldwide and regions in USA. Visualization of correlations between the parameters to analyse it's relation related to earthquake happened from 2012. 

Hypotheis:
Analysis and visualization of earthquakes by ploting on geographical maps and categorized based on the magnitutde level.
Classifications of regions based on the earthquake history over the years keeping the magnitude level under consideration.
Finding correlations between various parameters present in the data and it's effect on the earthquakes over regions.

The project is still in progress. 
Data Scource: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/
Downloaded over several years across regions.
